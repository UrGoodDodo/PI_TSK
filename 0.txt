Girl, tell me what you're doing on the other side
And so, just tell me what you're doing with that other guy
'Cause I ain't got patience to slow down the pace
All your girlfriends are wasted
They need it, they chase it
Face it, you want it, you crave it
Believe when I say that you'll know once you taste it

[Chorus: Mitchel Cave]
All of your friends have been here for too long
They must be waiting for you to move on (Woo)
Girl, I'm not with it, I'm way too far gone
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (Woo)
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now

[Verse 2: Mitchel Cave and Christian Anthony]
Just give me some time and space to realize
That you, were busy lying, sleeping 'round with other guys
And what the hell were we?
Tell me we weren't just friends
This doesn't make much sense, no
But I'm not hurt, I'm tense
'Cause I'll be fine without you, babe (Woo)

I'm not ready, eyes heavy now
Heart on your sleeve like you've never been loved
Running in circles, now look what you've done (Woo)
Give you my word as you take it and run
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)

[Outro: Mitchel Cave]
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now
I'm not ready, eyes heavy now (Woo)
Wish you'd let me stay, I'm ready now (Woo)
